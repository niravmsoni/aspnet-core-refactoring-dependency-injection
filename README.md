# Offloading Composition Root responsibilities to a separate class library
	- Often times, we see the Program.cs overburdened with all the service registrations as well as the code to invoke/start the application.
		- Problem
			- With this structure we have 2 different things tied together i.e. EntryPoint and CompositionRoot
			- This is a console application that imports products from csv and outputs them to csv or Database.
			- If we want to run the importer from another application (For ex: WebAPI), we would require a lot of refactoring since we would reuse all the core logic

		- Solution
			- Offloading responsibilities of doing the service registrations in a separate class library project
			- All the registrations are done either in WebAPI.Program class or are done in respective project by writing extension methods on IServiceCollection
			- Before
				- If we follow clean architecture practices, we typically have this structure
					- WebAPI - Has reference of Domain, Application and Infrastructure projects
					- Domain
					- Application
					- Infrastructure
			- After
				- A better way to deal with such registrations is by creating a CompositionRoot(Separate project).
					- WebAPI - Has reference only of CompositionRoot project
					- CompositionRoot - Has reference of Domain, Application and Infrastructure projects
					- Domain
					- Application
					- Infrastructure
